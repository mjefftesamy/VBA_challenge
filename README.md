# Purpose of Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to analyse the fluctuation of the stock indexes between 2017 and 2018. In order to perform this studies, daily datas have been collected and we will use VBA to analyse their total volume and their return for the year.


# Result

Based on the result that we have got, the stock returns in 2017 were better compared to 2018. the script used for this analysis is and the various code that we use to analyze our datas in 2017 most of our indexes had a positive outcome in the stock market whereas the ones of 2018 have had a negative outcome for the most part. we can deduct the market have been severely affected in 2018. 

Attached is the different codes and scripts that we use to analyze those datas.

# Advantage of refactory code

1. Refactoring is a really good weapon to maintain the code 2. It's interesting thing to do whether part of current task or as a separate task 3. Make the code clean and organized 4. Help to follow principles like SOLID, GRASP, etc...


# Disadvantage of Refactoring Code
1. It's risky when the application is big 2. It's risky when the existing code doesn't have proper rest case.

# Pros and Cons of Code Refactoring

There are many Pros of Code Refactoring including the following ones:

It can significantly boost system performance, as the refactored code is quick to respond because of its simplicity.
It reduces technical debt which would consequently minimize the time and resources needed to detect and fix bugs.
It allows you to modify some elements of the system in order for it to cater to the ever-changing business needs.
Among the Cons of Code Refactoring are the following factors:

Code refactoring is time-consuming. It takes anywhere between 50-150 hours to update the technology stack for small projects. Big projects requiring major changes on the backend and the frontend may easily take over 500 hours.
If you need to make some big changes to the system and modify the system’s structure, it’s easier to build new software from scratch.
The best time to start refactoring is right before rolling out an update for your system. It would not only improve the software performance but would significantly simplify the integration of new features.

Another good time to think of code refactoring is during the development stage. While trying to speed up the development process, companies often sacrifice the quality of a final product. The code smells can cause significant problems in the future, so it’s better to eliminate them right away.
